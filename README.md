# üìä Online Course Analytics Dashboard

## Overview  
This project features an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** designed to analyze the performance and trends of a large online course platform. The dashboard provides a comprehensive, data-driven view of key business metrics, including **revenue generation, subscriber growth, audience engagement, and content distribution** across various dimensions like time, course level, and pricing models.  

The insights derived are crucial for **strategic decision-making in content strategy, marketing, pricing, and resource allocation**.

## üéØ Key Insights & Analysis  

- **Monetization & Popularity:** The vast majority of courses (92%) are paid, indicating a strong monetization strategy. Paid courses are the primary driver of the platform's revenue.  
- **Exponential Growth:** Both the total number of subscribers and total revenue have seen significant year-over-year growth, with a particularly sharp increase from 2015 onwards.  
- **Content Strategy:** All Levels courses are the most popular, making up over half (54.53%) of all content. This is followed by Beginner Level courses (52.45%), suggesting a market heavily skewed towards learners new to a subject.  
- **Seasonal Trends:** Revenue and reviews peak in March, indicating this is a high-activity period for course purchases and engagement. The latter half of the year (Q4) shows a relative dip in revenue.  
- **Engagement Correlation:** A positive correlation is observed between the number of subscribers and the number of reviews, which is a common indicator of course satisfaction and community engagement.
